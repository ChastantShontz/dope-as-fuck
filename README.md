## Conductor Simulator

#### The Clarkson University pep band video game

---

Hello there!

If you don't know me, I am Chestnut, a Clarkson University alum from the class of 2024. I majored in communication, media, & design here \(back when that was still a thing\) and played the cowbell offbeat in our pep band. To me, this band was not just a club, but my "family away from home".

I created *Conductor Simulator* during my sophomore year \(almost entirely while drunk after "milk and cookies" get-togethers\). It was meant to be an outlet for my love of the band, and potentially a way to teach future freshmen our ways. It is my hope that this game outlives my time at Clarkson and goes on to entertain bandies for years to come.

But alas, I will not be here forever. As I type this out now, the best four years of my life are already coming to an end. Included below are instructions on how to maintain this game in my absence. If you're reading this, it means that you were selected as a worthy successor to guard my greatest accomplishment.

Hope you enjoy it!

###### Instructions:

1. First, you must make sure that the game is well-maintained. Here are a few common updates you may need to make:

    1. Every time a pep band email is sent out, add all the quotes in it to the array `quotes`. They should be ordered alphabetically going by their pure text content, not factoring in any nested HTML tags. If any of these quotes are exchanges between two or more people, wrap each line in a `<span>` that has the class `quoteLine` and an ID that is `quoteLine` + \[ordered number\], and separate them with `<br>` tags. Wherever there is a quote inside a quote, instead of putting quotation marks around the inner one, place it in a `<span>` with the class `quoteLineNested`. This will automatically adjust the type of quotation marks and the font-style to fit this context. Also add the authors of each quote to the appropriate key, with all their names \(but not the names of anyone the quote was merely said **TO**\) wrapped in `<b>` tags. When the senior spotlights on Instagram \([https://www.instagram.com/clarksonpepband](https://www.instagram.com/clarksonpepband)\) are coming out at the end of each year, repeat this whole process for their featured quotes if they have not previously appeared in an email.

    2. Add any new bandies to the array `bandies`. This should at the very least be done at the beginning of each year when a new freshman class arrives. You can use nicknames instead of their real names if that is what they go by \(ie. "Chestnut" instead of "Chastant"\). If there is already a bandie with the same first name there, add their last names to differentiate them. Be sure to do this to all occurences of these names in `page.js`, even the ones that are not in `bandies`. The function `changeName(element)` changes the names of various bandies to joke nicknames of theirs when the elements containing them are hovered over. To do this for a new bandie's name, simply add another if (not if **ELSE**, because multiple names can be changed at the same time) loop to it and create a regular expression that matches this name. It may be helpful to test your regular expressions in the codepen at [https://regex101.com](https://regex101.com) before plugging it into `page.js`. Then add a corresponding if loop to the function `changeNameBack(element)` that uses a regular expression to target the nickname you have just changed the original name to.

    3. If any songs are added to the set list, you may include them as well. However, make sure that in the array `songs`, *Tijuana* remains number 70 in alphabetical order so that it is number 69 when indexed. You may have to remove one of the lesser songs above *Tijuana* to make this work. Songs are designated as the correct choice by setting `sessionStorage.songPrime` to their index numbers. If the inclusion of a new song has changed the order of `songs` enough that the wrong songs are being called here, update these numbers accordingly. For each object in `songs`, make sure that you fill out all the necessary fields correctly. If some or all of the text in `title` should be rendered in italics, insert `<i>` tags in the appropriate places. Always list the people who wrote the original song for `artist` instead of anyone who performed a cover of it, even if the cover version is the one the pep band plays. Not all of the songs will need to have an accompanying image, but still fill out `image` using the same naming syntax as `audio`. `duration` is given in seconds and `lyrics` is written in camel case, or an empty string if there are none. Changes made to `songs` must also be reflected in three other places: the `audio` folder that contains `.mp3` files for each song, the `<audio>` HTML elements in the `<section>` element `audios` that contain these files as sources, and the `<select>` element `speakerSongs` where each song is an `<option>`. You can easily download the `.mp3` files by installing \(for free!\) 4K Video Downloader. Make sure that Smart Mode is enabled and select `C:\Users\chast\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\dope-as-fuck\audio` for the file path. Choose `Audio` for `Download`, `Highest` for `Quality`, and `MP3` for `Format`. Then copy the URL of a YouTube video of the song and click the `Paste Link` to parse it. When this is done, save the audio as \[song name in camel case\] + `.mp3`. In `audios`, each `<audio>` element should have its `preload` attribute set to `metadata`, the class `audio`, and an ID that is the same as the path to its audio file without the `audio/` at the beginning and the `.mp3` at the end. Place a `<source>` tag inside each one that has the **FULL** file path as its `src`, and set its `type` attribute to `audio/mp3`. The corresponding `<option>` elements in `speakerSongs` should have their `value` attributes set to this same string, the class `speakerSong`, and IDs that are `speakerSong` + \[index number \(starting at 1, not 0, since the first one is the default choice\)\]. Adjust these numbers in all the elements after the one that you have just added, just like you previously did with `sessionStorage.songPrime` in `page.js`.

    4. Any new cheers should be placed inside the `<ul>` element `cheers`. At the highest level, each one needs an `<li>` with the class `cheer` and an ID that is `cheer` + \[index number \(also starting at 1\)\]. Dont's worry about any CSS styling, the class will make it conform to the other cheers. Inside that, put a `<p>` and a `<div>`. Give them classes and IDs using the same naming conventions, replacing `cheer` with `cheerMessage` for the `<p>` and `cheerCover` for the `<div>`. Be sure to adjust these numbers accordingly in all the cheers after this new one. The actual text of the cheer goes inside `cheerMessage`. If it includes any gender-specific pronouns in references to the hockey players, use the gender-neutral version of it as a placeholder \(ie. "they" instead of "he"/"she", "them" instead of "him"/"her", etc.\) and wrap that individual word in a `<span>`. Give this span the class `pronoun`, another one which is the word itself \(without any suffixes, such as the "'re"/"'ll" in "they're"/"they'll"\), and yet another that is `pronoun` + \[Lower/Upper\] depending on whether the first letter of the word in question should be lower or uppercase. The function `pronoun()` will later go through and replace this word with the appropriate pronoun once the player has selected a gender. Now, you must decide how and when the cheer will be called. There are three different levels, with each one bestowing a different number of points: 1 point if it can be called at any time, 2 if if can be called sometimes but still fairly often \(ie. for a whole period of play\), and 3 points if it can only be called in very specific circumstances \(ie. whenever Clarkson scores a goal\). If this is a level 1 cheer, give it the classes `lowCheer` and `correctCheer`. If not, give it the classes \[mid/high\] + `Cheer` and `incorrectCheer`. All cheers should also get the class `unusedCheer`. Once again, give the `cheerMessage` and `cheerCover` corresponding classes with these naming conventions by adding `Message` and `Cover`, respectively, to the end of the names. If your cheer is being inserted before all the others, give it the class `firstCheer` and remove this class from the cheer that was previously at the top. Do the same with the class `lastCheer` if it is being inserted after all the others. If it is conditional on the gender of the hockey players \(ie. mentions Allin or Hope's name\), give it the classes `genderedCheer` and \[male/female\] + `Cheer`. A for loop in `page.js` will determine whether these cheers should be displayed depending on which gender the player selects at the beginning of the game. These last few classes should only be applied to the cheer itself, not to the `cheerMessage` or `cheerCover`. Give the `cheerCover` the onclick event `cheer(cheer, pointsIncrement)`, where the first parameter is the cheer's index number and the second is what level it is. You must then adjust all the index numbers in `page.js`. In the `cheer(cheer, pointsIncrement)` function, there are some cheers that call functions specific to them when clicked on. The cheer indexes are stored using `sessionStorage.cheer` here, and are the same as the numbers in their IDs. The cheers are also called by the function `enableCheers(enableClassLists, enableStyles)`, which replaces all the `incorrectCheer` classes with `correctCheer` ones \(or `semiCorrectCheer`, in the case of the `"Boat...ship!"` cheer\) and sets the `cheerCover` to `display: block`. For each instance of this, `enableCheers(enableClassLists, enableStyles)` is passed two arrays of strings as parameters. The first one tells it what cheers it should modify the class list for and the second says which ones it should change the `display` attribute on. In cases where the cheer is clickable but results in the player losing a life, the latter action could be performed but not the former. Inside `enableCheers(enableClassLists, enableStyles)`, each string that they contain is converted into readable code with the `eval()` method and plugged into an if loop to see if it should be applied. To add your new cheer, find all the occurences of `enableCheers(enableClassLists, enableStyles)` where you would like it to be called and add a string that says `"j == "` + \[index number\] to each array. If there is not already one in the correct place, you can make one by copy/pasting the code `var enableClassLists = [];` + \[new line\] + `var enableStyles = [];` + \[new line\] + `enableCheers(enableClassLists, enableStyles);`. Remember that here, the index numbers are one less than the numbers in the IDs and `sessionStorage.cheer` for the corresponding cheers. Some of the cheers result in the player losing a life when they are clicked on. If yours is like this, only add to enableStyles and not enableClassLists to toggle the `display` attribute but not the class list. If you want your cheer to only do this under specific circumstances, you can add as many extra conditions as you want \(ie. `"(j == 33) && (sessionStorage.gender == 2)"` if you want `cheer34` to only take a life away if said to a female hockey player\). In `cheer(cheer, pointsIncrement)`, there is an else if loop with the condition `else if (document.getElementById("cheer" + sessionStorage.cheer).classList.contains("incorrectCheer"))` that decides if Troy Lassial will show up to take that life. There is another else if loop inside of if that determines what Troy will say by setting the inner HTML of the `<p>` element `troyLassialTalk`, so just add a loop with your own cheer to it and give Troy some lines. Yet another else if loop toward the top of the function allows Joe to make a comment in response to specific cheers, if this is something you would like. If you want to change the text of your cheer when it is hovered over, give its outer `<li>` element the onmouseenter event `changeCheer(element)` and the onmouseleave event `changeCheerBack(element)`, with its parameter being the index number. In the corresponding functions in `page.js`, you can then add a pair of extra else if loops that includes your cheer. Use `changeCheer(element)` to specify the inner HTML that your cheer should have when hovered over \(be sure to include any inline HTML tags, such as the `<span>`\), and copy/paste its original inner HTML in `changeCheerBack(element)`. In all these loops, the cheers are checked by examining their inner HTML, which saves you the trouble of having having index numbers that must be changed every time you add a new cheer. To deactivate your cheer if it has not been called, simply reverse the changes to its class list and `display` attribute by plugging the same conditions into the arrays `disableClassLists` and `disableStyles` right before the function `disableCheers(disableClassLists, disableStyles)` runs. Once again, you can add extra conditions to ensure that it is only deactivated under specific circumstances.

    5. For new verses in the drinking songs, put each line in the appropriate `<select>` element. They are contained in a `<div>` with an ID that is \[song name\] + `LinesCont`. The first line should be inserted alphabetically while the second \(and third, for *The S&M Man* and *High Above Cayuga's Waters*\) should have the same index as it in its/their parent `<select>`. Add all the necessary classes to each new line using the conventions that you observe with their sibling elements, and give it an ID that is \[song name\] + \[verse/response\] + \[index number\]. Just like with the cheers, the verse at the top and its corresponding responses should get the class `firstLine`, and the ones at the bottom should get `lastLine`. Lines that are conditional on the gender of the hockey players should also get the classes `genderedLine` and \[male/female\] + `Line` the same way that the cheers do. *The S&M Man* verse that says `"Who can take Shane?"` and its corresponding responses are set to `display: none` in `main.css`, so be sure to update the numbers in their IDs accordingly. Also add the new verses to the Google Doc `Dope As Fuck Songs`. Unlike in the code, the verses here are organized according to the natural flow of the songs, not alphabetically. Then download it as a PDF \(`File > Download > PDF Document (.pdf)`\), save it as `songs.pdf`, and replace the old file of the same name with it.

    6. All new `<img>` tags must have the `onload` event of `load(event)` in addition to any other unique ones so that the loading time of the page can be accurately calculated.

    7. If any of the previous changes altered the front-end appearance of the game, you must replace the image `preview.png` with a new one that reflects this. Play your way through the game until you get to the stage where the conductor's text box says `"The pregame's over, time for the real game to begin! This is going to be fun! Watch as they do the puck drop."` \(the function `gotIt12()` if you're following along on the back-end\). Select `Men` for the gender when asked and be extra careful to guess all the songs correctly. Make sure all the hockey player stats are hidden, the `<ul>` element `cheers` is scrolled all the way up to the top, the `<div>` element `raffle` is not obviously noticeable, nothing is highlighted or tabbed, the cursor is off to the side where it cannot be seen, and the screen's brightness is turned up to the max. Do not hover over any players, click on any cheers, click the conductor image to turn him into a pillow, or open your account. If any of these conditions are not met, go back to the beginning and play through the game again. Then expand the browser window to fullscreen \(`F11`, although you may have to hold down `Fn` as well depending on your computer\) and take a screenshot \(`Meta + Print Screen`\). Go to [https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/resize-image.php](https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/resize-image.php) and select the screenshot that you just took to be resized. Set its new width to `3840` and leave the height field blank. Choose `Keep aspect ratio` for `Type of resizing`, `Automatic` for `Interpolation`, `0` for `Size in DPI`, `PNG-24 (without compression, with transparency support)` for `Output image format`, and `Yes` for `Copy EXIF and other metadata?`. Then click the `OK` button at the bottom to start resizing. When this is done, `Download processed image` and delete the original. After also deleting the previous version of `preview.png` in the `img` folder, save the new image with the same name and store it in the same location.

    8. Any changes made to `header.cpp` must also be applied to `users.cpp`, the corresponding file in Visual Studio. When that is done, navigate to `C:\Users\chast\OneDrive\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Projects\users` and move `users.cpp` up two levels so that it is outside of the `Projects` solution, before deleting this solution. In Visual Studio, `Create a new project` and select `Console App` for the template. Choose `users` for `Project name`, `C:\Users\chast\OneDrive\Documents\Visual Studio 2022` for the file path, and `Projects` for `Solution name`. Also make sure that the box to `Place solution and project in the same directory` is **NOT** checked. Then click the `Create` button in the bottom right. It should be created with the folders `users` \(which itself should contain the folder `x64` and the files `users.cpp`, `users.vcxproj`, `users.vcxproj.filters`, and `users.vcxproj.user`\) and `x64` and the file `Projects.sln`. Open this new project by clicking `users.vcxproj` in the `users` folder. Select `View > Solution Explorer` \(`Control + Alt + L`\), and this will open up a sidebar on the right. There, open `users > Source Files`, right-click or double-click on `users.cpp`, choose `Remove` \(`Delete`\), and confirm that you want to `Delete` it. Now move the old `users.cpp` back inside `Projects` and `users`. Right/double-click on `Source Files`, choose `Add > Existing Item` \(`Shift + Alt + A`\), and select `users.cpp`. To complete the build, select `Build > Build Solution` \(`Control + Shift + B`\).

    9. Continually update `config.yaml` so it reflects the contents of the `<head>` in `index.html`. Each `http-equiv`, `name`, `property`, or `itemprop` attribute should be a key, with the corresponding `content` attribute being a value. Attributes placed directly in the root `<html>` tag can also be included. Use arrays whenever the value is a comma-separated or space-separated list instead of putting them all in one string. This does not have to be an exact replica, so feel free to tidy it up by removing or combining similar keys, or by changing the names of keys to improve consistency. Associated keys \(ie. all the ones with the `og:` or `twitter:` prefixes\) should be grouped together into a single object. Do not combine any keys that are in different objects. Each `<link>` or `<script>` should also be included as an object, housed within the respective arrays `links` and `scripts`, that are themselves inside the object `resources`. The keys and values of these objects must correspond with the attributes of the elements they are representing. Inside `links` is nested the additional array `stylesheets` to hold all the **internal** CSS stylesheets \(not external ones, such as the Google Fonts or Icons\). Do not include any inline `<script>` tags, just ones that access their JavaScript through the `src` attribute, as these are not loaded resources.

    10. Update the instructions in this file if any of previous changes affect the operation or maintenance of the game. Be especially careful to update the text fragment in the URL if you linked to a specific step.

    11. After sizable chunks of edits, play the game through as a user would and test out all the major features to make sure that nothing has been in advertently broken.

2. Save any changes that you have made in VS Code. To commit them in GitHub Desktop, write a brief summary and description of these changes in the designated text fields and click the `Commit to main` button underneath. Then `Push to origin` \(`Control + P`\) so they can take effect on the actual website \(it may take a few minutes for this to update\).

3. Open a path to the game's source folder, `C:\Users\chast\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\dope-as-fuck`, in your file explorer \(`Control + Shift + F`\). Right/double-click on it and select `Compress to ZIP file`. This will create a zipped folder called `dope-as-fuck.zip`. Then email it to yourself \(if you are using Gmail, it will have to be sent as a Google Drive link due to its size\). This will guard against the possibility of your computer getting physically damaged during the following process and losing all its data.

4. Make **TWO** copies of the unzipped source folder \(`Control + C`, `Control + V`\) and delete the original. When you return to GitHub, you will see a message saying `"Can't find "dope-as-fuck""`. Select the option to `Remove` it. In VS Code, go to the `Explorer`, right/double-click on the folder beneath the workspace, and select `Remove Folder from Workspace`.

5. Pull up this repository's page on your online GitHub account at [https://github.com/ChastantShontz/dope-as-fuck](https://github.com/ChastantShontz/dope-as-fuck). Go to the `Settings` tab and scroll all the way down to the `Danger Zone` where the `Delete this repository` button is located. GitHub will have you confirm this action in several different ways, including typing in `"ChastantShontz/dope-as-fuck"`, before it can go through.

6. Create a new GitHub repository \(`Control + N`\). Write `"dope-as-fuck"` for its name and `"The Clarkson University pep band video game"` for its description. If GitHub tells you `"This directory appears to be a Git repository. Would you like to add this repository instead?"`, it means that you did not delete the previous repository properly. Select `C:\Users\chast\OneDrive\Documents\Github` for the file path, check the box to `Initialize this repository with a README`, and make sure that the `Git ignore` and `License` are both set to `None`. Then click the `Create repository` button at the bottom. It should be created with the \(hidden\) folder `.git` and the files `README.md` and `.gitattributes`. Next, publish your new repository \(`Control + P` again\). Do not change its name or description when asked. **UN**check the box to `Keep this code private` and make sure that the `Organization` is also set to `None`. Click the `Publish repository` button to finalize this.

7. In one of the two copies of the original source folder, delete the folders `.vscode` and `.git` \(this one may be hidden by default, so select `View > Show > Hidden items` to reveal it\) and the file `.gitattributes`. Then copy/paste everything else into the source folder for the new repository. There should be 503 items, including the folders `fonts`, `img`, `video`, and `audio` and the files `index.html`, `main.css`, `normalize.css`, `page.js`, `data.json`, `captions.vtt`, `README.md`, `command.sh`, `config.yaml`, `songs.pdf`, `header.cpp`, `code.m`, and `source.txt`. Select `Replace the file in the destination` when prompted with `"The destination already has a file named "README.md""` since there will now be two copies of it. Check that this folder is now 675MB \(or 346MB, if the `.git` folder is hidden\) to make sure that everything has copied over with no problems. If it is less than that, carefully go through the other copy to see which items have not and move them over from there.

8. Commit all these files in GitHub \(you may want to do this in chunks to speed up the process\) and push all 459 changed files to the origin. If this fails due to the sheer number of files, simply delete the current repository and its source folder. Using the unchanged copy of the original as the new source folder, then repeat steps [`4.`](https://github.com/ChastantShontz/dope-as-fuck?tab=readme-ov-file#:~:text=Make%20TWO%20copies%20of%20the%20unzipped%20source%20folder%20%28Control%20%2B%20C%2C%20Control%20%2B%20V%29%20and%20delete%20the%20original%2E%20When%20you%20return%20to%20GitHub%2C%20you%20will%20see%20a%20message%20saying%20%22Can%27t%20find%20%22dope%2Das%2Dfuck%22%22%2E%20Select%20the%20option%20to%20Remove%20it%2E%20In%20VS%20Code%2C%20go%20to%20the%20Explorer%2C%20right%2Fdouble%2Dclick%20on%20the%20folder%20beneath%20the%20workspace%2C%20and%20select%20Remove%20Folder%20from%20Workspace%2E), [`5.`](https://github.com/ChastantShontz/dope-as-fuck?tab=readme-ov-file#:~:text=Pull%20up%20this%20repository%27s%20page%20on%20your%20online%20GitHub%20account%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Fgithub%2Ecom%2FChastantShontz%2Fdope%2Das%2Dfuck%2E%20Go%20to%20the%20Settings%20tab%20and%20scroll%20all%20the%20way%20down%20to%20the%20Danger%20Zone%20where%20the%20Delete%20this%20repository%20button%20is%20located%2E%20GitHub%20will%20have%20you%20confirm%20this%20action%20in%20several%20different%20ways%2C%20including%20typing%20in%20%22ChastantShontz%2Fdope%2Das%2Dfuck%22,%20before%20it%20can%20go%20through%2E), [`6.`](https://github.com/ChastantShontz/dope-as-fuck?tab=readme-ov-file#:~:text=Create%20a%20new%20GitHub%20repository%20%28Control%20%2B%20N%29%2E%20Write%20%22dope%2Das%2Dfuck%22%20for%20its%20name%20and%20%22The%20Clarkson%20University%20pep%20band%20video%20game%22%20for%20its%20description%2E%20If%20GitHub%20tells%20you%20%22This%20directory%20appears%20to%20be%20a%20Git%20repository%2E%20Would%20you%20like%20to%20add%20this%20repository%20instead%3F%22%2C%20it%20means%20that%20you%20did%20not%20delete%20the%20previous%20repository%20properly%2E%20Select%20C%3A%5CUsers%5Cchast%5COneDrive%5CDocuments%5CGitHub%20for%20the%20file%20path%2C%20check%20the%20box%20to%20Initialize%20this%20repository%20with%20a%20README%2C%20and%20make%20sure%20that%20the%20Git%20ignore%20and%20License%20are%20both%20set%20to%20None%2E%20Then%20click%20the%20Create%20repository%20button%20at%20the%20bottom%2E%20It%20should%20be%20created%20with%20the%20%28hidden%29%20folder%20%2Egit%20and%20the%20files%20README%2Emd%20and%20%2Egitattributes%2E%20Next%2C%20publish%20your%20new%20repository%20%28Control%20%2B%20P%20again%29%2E%20Do%20not%20change%20its%20name%20or%20description%20when%20asked%2E%20Uncheck%20the%20box%20to%20Keep%20this%20code%20private%20and%20make%20sure%20that%20the%20Organization%20is%20also%20set%20to%20None%2E%20Click%20the%20Publish%20repository%20button%20to%20finalize%20this%2E), and [`7.`](https://github.com/ChastantShontz/dope-as-fuck?tab=readme-ov-file#:~:text=In%20one%20of%20the%20two%20copies%20of%20the%20original%20source%20folder%2C%20delete%20the%20folders%20%2Evscode%20and%20%2Egit%20%28this%20one%20may%20be%20hidden%20by%20default%2C%20so%20select%20View%20%3E%20Show%20%3E%20Hidden%20items%20to%20reveal%20it%29%20and%20the%20file%20%2Egitattributes%2E%20Then%20copy%2Fpaste%20everything%20else%20into%20the%20source%20folder%20for%20the%20new%20repository%2E%20There%20should%20be%20503%20items%2C%20including%20the%20folders%20fonts%2C%20img%2C%20video%2C%20and%20audio%20and%20the%20files%20index%2Ehtml%2C%20main%2Ecss%2C%20normalize%2Ecss%2C%20page%2Ejs%2C%20data%2Ejson%2C%20captions%2Evtt%2C%20README%2Emd%2C%20command%2Esh%2C%20config%2Eyaml%2C%20songs%2Epdf%2C%20header%2Ecpp%2C%20code%2Em%2C%20andsource%2Etxt%2E%20Select%20Replace%20the%20file%20in%20the%20destination%20when%20prompted%20with%20%22The%20destination%20already%20has%20a%20file%20named%20%22README%2Emd%22%22%20since%20there%20will%20now%20be%20two%20copies%20of%20it%2E%20Check%20that%20this%20folder%20is%20now%20675MB%20%28or%20346MB%2C%20if%20the%20%2Egit%20folder%20is%20hidden%29%20to%20make%20sure%20that%20everything%20has%20copied%20over%20with%20no%20problems%2E%20If%20it%20is%20less%20than%20that%2C%20carefully%20go%20through%20the%20other%20copy%20to%20see%20which%20items%20have%20not%20and%20move%20them%20over%20from%20there%2E) until this step succeeds.

9. Go back into VS Code and click on the `Open Folder` button where the folder used to be. Then select the new `C:\Users\chast\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\dope-as-fuck` folder to add. Make sure you have the extention `Script` by `nur` installed and enabled. If you do, it will prompt you to `"Create script. (dope-as-fuck)"`. Choose `Create`, and this will make a new `.vscode` folder with the files `main.js` and `jsconfig.json` in it. Commit and push both of these in GitHub.

10. Refresh GitHub in your browser and a new repository called `dope-as-fuck` will be there. To publish it online, go to `Settings > Pages`. It will list `None` as the current source branch, so click the dropdown menu and select `main` instead. This should be the only option unless you have branched it. When you click the `Save` button, it will generate the link [https://chastantshontz.github.io/dope-as-fuck](https://chastantshontz.github.io/dope-as-fuck) as its URL. It can take up to half an hour for the website to be fully published, so if you try to visit this URL right away, you will likely get a 404 error.

11. When \(**and ONLY when!!!**\) you have confirmed that the website has been properly published, delete the two copies of the old folder from your file explorer and OneDrive \(only if the changes have not yet synced and deleted them from here automatically, otherwise you will be deleting the version that you just created\). Also be sure to delete the zipped folder in your Google Drive if you previously used Gmail to email it to yourself, otherwise your storage will get clogged up with multiple copies after repeating this process a few times.

12. **\(Bonus step...\)** And most importantly of all, don't let the game fall into the wrong hands! It contains secret details on every aspect of pep band culture, and if certain people \(ie. Troy Lassial\) were to find this out, it could lead to the downfall of the pep band as we know it. No pressure though!
